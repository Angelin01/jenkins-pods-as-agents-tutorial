# Rusty Report Printer

This application is a port from our super-report-printer application to Rust!

It prints a report on our metrics to show how amazing we are!

We missed using Node, so we now use it to generate the report instead.

## Requirements:

Rust >= 1.58  
Node >= 16

## Report

The report can be generated by running the `report_generator.js` script:
```shell
./report_generator.js
```

Afterwards, it will be available in `resources/report.json`!

## Building and Running

Build the Rust code:
```shell
cargo build
# or, for release
cargo build --release
```

Make sure you generated the report like explained above before running!

Run the code:
```shell
target/debug/rusty-report-printer
# or, for release
target/release/rusty-report-printer
```

Note: it looks for the report in `resources/report.json`, relative to the current working directory!

## Docker

We have a Docker image! Build it using:
```shell
docker build -t rusty-report-printer:v0.1.0 .
```

Note: you also need the report above to have been generated!
